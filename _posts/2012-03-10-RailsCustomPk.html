title: Creating custom Primary Keys in Rails
tags: Ruby, Rails, MySQL
---

<p>
Having recently discovered Ruby/Rails, I decided to explore Rail's integration with legacy
databases so that I could write one-off scripts to manipulate our
databases with it (while learning ruby/rails at the same time!). One of the first things I ran into was the need to generate
custom primary keys (can't use auto-incrementing keys!). A little bit
of googling around led me to this simple solution
</p>



<pre class="example">require 'active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_mysql_adapter'
require 'mysql2'

module  ActiveRecord
  module ConnectionAdapters
    class Mysql2Adapter &lt; AbstractMysqlAdapter
      @tn
      def prefetch_primary_key?(table_name)
        @tn = table_name
        true
      end

      def next_sequence_value(sequence_name)
        id = select_value("SELECT id from #{@tn} ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1",'id')
        id+1;
      end
    end
  end
end
</pre>




<p>
Defining the prefetch_primary_key function tells the rails framework
to call next_sequence_value to get the primary key. You can set the
value of sequence_name in your models using  set_sequence_name. Since
I was essentially 'implementing' auto-increment I simply decided to
store the table_name and use that instead of setting the sequence_name
in all my models. Obviously this is not a very robust/production ready
solution/thread safe etc., but for those who are just 'hacking'
around, this is a handy technique if you need to generate your own
primary key ids.

And a quick tip to see what the ORM is generating if you are simply
exploring your models -
</p>



<pre class="example">logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = logger
ActiveResource::Base.logger = logger
</pre>



<p>
This will conviniently log all the SQL statements that your ORM is
issuing.Happy Hacking!
