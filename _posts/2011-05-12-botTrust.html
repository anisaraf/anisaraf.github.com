<h3 id="sec-1">Solution Analysis </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1">

<p>   Lets list some important things about the problem:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The buttons need to be pressed in order. 
</li>
<li>The Robots can move simultaneously (However given above condition they
     will never press buttons simultaneously)
</li>
<li>Robots begin at position 1
</li>
</ul>


<p>
   We could do a brute-force solution where we store all the moves for
   each robot. Then at any given point it is trivial to say what the
   robot should do next. However we could just accumulate time for
   the robot, and when it's his turn to press the button we could go
   'back' in time, and move him appropriately. Lets look at some code
</p>



<pre class="src src-c++"><span style="color: #00cdcd;">class</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">Robot</span> {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">m_currPos</span>;
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">m_accumulatedSeconds</span>;

<span style="color: #00cdcd;">public</span>:
  <span style="color: #87d7ff;">Robot</span>() : m_currPos(1), m_accumulatedSeconds(0) {} ;
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">moveMe</span>(<span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">position</span>) {
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">requiredSeconds</span> = abs(position - m_currPos) + 1 - m_accumulatedSeconds;
    m_accumulatedSeconds = 0;
    m_currPos = position;
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">return</span> requiredSeconds &gt; 0 ? requiredSeconds : 1;
  }

  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">accumulateSeconds</span>(<span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">seconds</span>){
    m_accumulatedSeconds+=seconds;
  }
};
</pre>





<p>
So each Robot has two states - his current position and how much time
he has accumulated since his last move. The key insight here is that
the robot moves only when he needs to press the button. Otherwise we
can just keep accumulating seconds. This saves us from needing to know
each Robot's next move! We can defer the decision to move till we know
where we need to move. Another nice thing about making this Robot
class is that we can have more than two Robots, and our solution would
work perfectly well. 
</p>
<p>
Lets examine the logic in the MoveMe method a little in
detail. Required seconds basically calculates how many seconds its
going to take the Robot to press the button. abs(position - m_currPos)
calcuates the number of seconds it requries to move and + 1 is for
pressing the button. We then subtract the accumulated seconds the
robot has, since he would have been moving towards the button in those
seconds. We then reset the state of the robot as having no accumulated
seconds and set his currenet position. We then return the total number
of seconds it took to press the button so that other robots can
accumulate time. Note that the minimum amount of time we return is 1
since it always takes at least 1 second to press the button, even if
the robot was already at the required position.

Now lets look at the Game class which controls the movement of these
robots 
</p>



<pre class="src src-c++"><span style="color: #00cdcd;">class</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">Game</span> {  
<span style="color: #00cdcd;">public</span>:
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">move</span>(<span style="color: #87ff87;">Robot</span>&amp; <span style="color: #ffd787;">rMove</span>, <span style="color: #87ff87;">Robot</span>&amp; <span style="color: #ffd787;">rAccumulate</span>, <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">pos</span>)
  {
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">secs</span> = rMove.moveMe(pos);
    rAccumulate.accumulateSeconds(secs);
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">return</span> secs;
  }

  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">start</span>(<span style="color: #00cdcd;">const</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span>&amp; <span style="color: #ffd787;">moves</span>) { 
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">istringstream</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">in</span>(moves);
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">nextPos</span>, <span style="color: #ffd787;">temp</span>, <span style="color: #ffd787;">totalSeconds</span>=0;
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">char</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">cNextRobot</span>;
    <span style="color: #87ff87;">Robot</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">ro</span>, <span style="color: #ffd787;">rb</span>;

    in &gt;&gt; temp;
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">while</span>(! in.eof()) {
      in&gt;&gt;cNextRobot&gt;&gt;nextPos;
      <span style="color: #00cdcd;">if</span>(cNextRobot == <span style="color: #ffaf87;">'O'</span>) 
        totalSeconds += <span style="color: #00cdcd;">this</span>-&gt;move(ro , rb, nextPos);     
      <span style="color: #00cdcd;">else</span>
        totalSeconds += <span style="color: #00cdcd;">this</span>-&gt;move(rb , ro, nextPos);
    }
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">return</span> totalSeconds;
  }
};
</pre>




<p>
The move method basically takes the Robot to move, along with the
position to move him too and the Robot which
will be accumulating the seconds. Then it simply calls the respective
functions on for the Robots. The start function is mostly parsing code, and most of this should be
self-explanatory.

<b>Disclaimer</b>: 
As always, my goal of solving these problems is not to write quick
unreadable code. Most of the solutions written by
<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/scoreboard?c=975485#vf=1">top</a> contestants at these competitions are obfusctated and difficult to
understand. My goal is to write <a href="http://stack247.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/principles-of-human-readable-code/">human readable</a> code which is open to
changing specifications - like in the real world. Efficiency,
performance and even correctness(some of these problems are tough!)
are secondary goals. However comments for improving all aspects of the
code are appreciated :)
