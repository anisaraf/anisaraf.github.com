<p>
As software developers, we need to be rapidly taking in information
and learning all the time. Therefore, it is essential that to become
better we become better learners. Now, each person has his own unique
learning style, and I feel it is important that they <b>consciously</b>
discover what works for them. This post is not advice, but mostly self
reflection, in an effort for me to optimize my own learning!

<h3 id="sec-1-1">Be consciously learning all the time. </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>   What do I mean by consciously learning? It means you need to make a
   conscious effort to learn. <a href="http://speakingmadefearless.com/blog/hard-wired-to-resist-change">Our brain is hard-wired to resists change</a>, and
   does what it knows how to do, even though it may not be
   efficient. As software developers, you should shun manual
   work. Write a script to do it, even if it takes longer! First you
   get to learn, and second - when you have to do it again ( yes you
   will need to sooner or later) you can just run your home-brew script :)
   You must be constantly looking for opportunities to learn,
   and questioning what you do.  For example: I recently needed to add
   ssh keys to my github account. Now I could simply cat/open the public key file and
   copy-paste it's contents using my mouse. I quickly thought that
   what I am doing seems inefficient, and there must be better ways to
   do it. A little bit of googling revealed the command pbcopy!
   Bingo - I learned something new, by doing a seemingly routine
   task. Learn to recognize learning opportunities. Apart from
   questioning what you are doing, question how you are doing it? Could
   you be doing it more efficiently? I bet you can. Invest time to
   learn your tools. Now granted this is a trivial example, but if you
   make it a habit to learn like this, you'll realize that you get
   things done quicker than others! And you know what that means
   right - yes more time on the beach - and of course more time to
   learn new things, so you can be even more efficient at what you do!
   It's a positive time-saving cycle!

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Don't ask for help </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>   Yes. Repeat that. Don't ask for help. Google. Search. Read the
   documentation. Even though it might take longer, the process of
   searching and skimming through links teaches you 10 different
   things. Suddenly you know a lot more about what you were
   searching. If you had asked, you would have probably been handed
   the answer, and never learned all these other wonderful things. It
   is only after you have exhausted all you options, that you should
   ask for help. Obviously, the caveat here is that you are not on a
   tight deadline - because sometimes, when you just need to get things
   done, it's better to ask!

<p>   Related to the above is learning to rapidly read and take in
   information. Can you <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/print/adv_op_ref.pdf">search efficiently</a>? Maybe devote some time
   learning how to speed read. Become good at finding and recognizing
   <b>useful</b> information.

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Be helpful </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>   Answer other people's queries. Go out of your way to find solutions
   for them. Why? Because these are real world issues and problems
   which you didn't have to discover yourself. They are just adding
   their own experience to yours. Be thankful for that!

<h3 id="sec-1-5">Collect what you learn </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">

<p>   This is very critical. I often find myself spending time to
   understand/figuring out some command. Days later, I need to redo
   the command - but I can't reconstruct it immediately. I need to
   resort to googling again, and finding the appropriate
   resources. Therefore create an appropriate system for storing and
   quickly retrieving all the new things you are learning. That way
   you can easily get to the resources later. It's a lot easier
   to recall using your own notes/resources you studied, rather than
   figuring out the solution from new resources. Even though it might
   take a little bit of time to create these notes, it will become an
   invaluable resource for you down the line. I use the excellent <a href="#org-mode.org">org mode</a> to track various tidbits of wisdom, but feel free to use any
   system to keep track of what you are learning.

<h3 id="sec-1-6">Time Management/ Tracking your progress </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">

<p>   Time management / progress tracking is absolutely critical in order
   to maximize your learning. At the end of the day, if you can do
   things faster than your co-workers, you save time - which you can
   then invest in learning how to do things even faster! Look at where
   your time is going? Could you be saving some of this time in order
   to improve your skill. Recognize inefficiencies in your daily
   routine and eliminate them. Save time, in order to create time to
   learn and improve! It's easy to fall into a daily routine where you
   are doing what you know/what's required of you. Constantly remind
   and question yourself - have I learned anything new
   today.

<div id="outline-container-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">Learn by doing or reading </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">

<p>   Recognize the different types of learning. There is a learning by
   reading ( <a href="#news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a>, <a href="#www.reddit.com-r-programming">reddit</a>, and
   various other blogs) and then there is the learning by
   doing. Remember to do both. A lot of the time it is easy to fall
   into the learn by reading trap, where you skim a lot of things only
   to promptly forget about it. While this kind of learning is
   important, it is equally important to do some planned
   reading/learning. While blogs etc. give you a much needed random
   learning, you also need to have a learning plan, where you are
   learning something new methodically.

<div id="outline-container-1-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-8">Quality over quantity </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">

<p>   A lot of the times when learning by doing, we tend to get stuck
   with quality. Don't worry about quality when you are
   learning/trying things out. Just do things, and do them a lot. I am
   guilty of this one, where I get stuck in a perfectionist trap - and
   that hinders my learning since I begin to feel that what I am doing
   is not good enough. That is specially true of writing and
   blogging. I spend a lot of time agonizing over little details of
   the post, which means I sink more time than I need to - and usually
   end up abandoning the post because it is not good. Recently - I've
   been practicing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing">free writing</a> and I think its a great technique to
   learn. Quantity over quality. You can always distill quality from
   quantity later!

<div id="outline-container-1-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-9">Do useless things </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">

<p>   And last but not least, do useless things. A lot of the time I
   question myself if whether what I am doing/learning is worth my
   time. This questioning leads to self-doubt and often I end up doing
   nothing but mindlessly surfing the web. Avoid the trap! The
   simplest solution is to pick something concrete to do, and then do
   it without expecting anything from it. Don't think of what you do
   as a start up or a hobby or an investment. Just do it, because you
   enjoy doing it! Think of it like watching TV. Once you convince
   yourself, it is leisure and not work - the pressure to get a return
   on your time is no longer there.
