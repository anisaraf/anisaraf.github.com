title:  TopCoder SRM 144 PenLift Part 2
---

<p>
As promised last week, lets look at each of the function calls in the
numtimes method. Please read <a href="http://www.codeherb.com/topcoder-srm-144-penlift">PART I</a> of this post if you haven't done
so already !  
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Private class level variable </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">





<pre class="src src-c">vector&lt;Line&gt; m_inLines;
set&lt;Point&gt; m_points; 
Graph&lt;Point&gt; m_graph;

</pre>



<p>
<b>minLines</b> stores the input data as Line Objects ( we'll explore the
line class in the next blog post !) 
</p>
<p>
<b>mpoints</b> stores all the unique points in our line segments - used
primarily during intersection
</p>
<p>
<b>mgraph</b> stores the graph formed by all our lines. We'll explore the
graph class in another blog post as well

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">void mergeLines(); </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">





<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">PenLift</span>::mergeLines(){ 
  <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(<span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>  = 0; i &lt; m_inLines.size(); ++i )
    <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(<span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">j</span> = i+1; j &lt; m_inLines.size(); ++j)
      <span class="org-keyword">if</span>(m_inLines[i].merge(m_inLines[j], m_inLines[i]))
        {
          m_inLines.erase(m_inLines.begin() + j);
          i--;
          <span class="org-keyword">break</span>;
        }
}
</pre>




<p>
So in order to merge the lines we run an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm. It takes a
line and compares it to every other line after it.
The merge function in the Line class looks like
<b>bool Line::merge(const Line&amp; other, Line&amp; inLine)</b> - the new merged
line is put in the second argument. So if there is a merge we replaces
the first line with the new merged line and erases the second line 
from  our vector.This in effect replaces the smaller lines with the new
merged line.The key thing to note is that this new line could have
been  merged with a line we had already seen and hence we decrement i
and break out of the loop.This way we start by  looking at this newly
merged line in the next iteration. And the end of this function call
all line that could be merged are merged. The merge logic itself is
handled by the Line class which we shall see next week. I wasn't too
bothered with efficiency I didn't bother optimizing this - but do let
me know if you come up with a more efficient way !

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">void intersectLines(); </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">





<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">PenLift</span>::intersectLines(){ 
  <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(<span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span>  = 0; i &lt; m_inLines.size(); ++i )
    <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(<span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">j</span> = i+1; j &lt; m_inLines.size(); ++j)
      {
        <span class="org-type">Point</span> <span class="org-variable-name">newPoint</span>;
        <span class="org-keyword">if</span>(m_inLines[i].intersection(m_inLines[j], newPoint))
          m_points.insert(Point(newPoint));
      }

  <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(set&lt;Point&gt;::iterator it = m_points.begin() ; it != m_points.end() ; ++it)
    splitLines(*it);
}
</pre>



<p>
Intersect lines works in an interesting way. What it does it first
creates all the points of intersection (again an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm) and
stores them in m<sub>points</sub>. Then it uses these intersections to call a
function to split our lines !

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">void splitLines(const Point&amp; point); </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">





<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">PenLift</span>::splitLines(<span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-type">Point</span>&amp; point)
{
  <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(<span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0; i &lt; m_inLines.size() ; i++) 
    <span class="org-keyword">if</span>(point != m_inLines[i].getStart() &amp;&amp; point != m_inLines[i].getEnd() &amp;&amp; m_inLines[i].isPointOnSegment(point)){
      m_inLines.push_back (Line(point, m_inLines[i].getEnd()) );
      m_inLines[i] = Line(point, m_inLines[i].getStart());
    }
}
</pre>



<p>
As explained above it takes all the points and splits each line into
that participates in the intersection into various different
lines. There can be edge cases here where we don't always create 4 new
lines. We could also intersect the same line multiple times at
different points. That is why each point runs through all the lines
splitting them if required and we don't stop after the first
split. Read the function carefully to see how it splits the lines and
handles various cases where there is an intersection but no new lines
are created !

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">void createGraph(); </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">





<pre class="src src-c"><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">PenLift</span>::createGraph(){
  <span class="org-keyword">for</span>(vector&lt;Line&gt;::iterator it = m_inLines.begin() ; it != m_inLines.end() ; ++it)
    m_graph.insertEdge(it-&gt;getStart(), it-&gt;getEnd());
}
</pre>



<p>
This is a simple function which basically constructs a graph out of
all the lines by inserting an edge between the start and end points of
the line segment.
</p>
<p>
This should give you an idea of the inner workings of the algorithms
and how to intersect and merge all those lines. We'll explore the
Graph, Line, and Point classes in future weeks !

PS: I am trying out <a href="http://orgmode.org">emacs org mode</a> for my blogging needs ! I'll post
about this soon. But let's just say I am becoming a fan of emacs org
mode !
