<p>
The other day, I felt the urge to write some code - and it was around
2:00 am. I had been struggling with understanding/implementing
the <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tutorials&amp;d2=hungarianAlgorithm">Hungarian Algorithm</a> for a while, and my brain just wanted to write
some code already! In order to pacify it - I decided to write some
simple code to get my juices flowing again. I picked on the trim
function which is notably missing from C++ standard libraries, and
relatively simple to understand.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the first pass of the code: 
</p>


<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">trim</span>(<span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">s</span>) {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">start</span>; <span style="color: #87ff87;">int</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">end</span>; 

  <span style="color: #00cdcd;">for</span>(start = 0; start &lt; s.length(); start++) {
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">if</span>(s[start] != <span style="color: #ffaf87;">' '</span>) 
      <span style="color: #00cdcd;">break</span>;
  }

  <span style="color: #00cdcd;">for</span>(end = s.length() - 1 ; end &gt; 0; end--) {
    <span style="color: #00cdcd;">if</span>(s[end] != <span style="color: #ffaf87;">' '</span>) 
      <span style="color: #00cdcd;">break</span>;
  }

  <span style="color: #00cdcd;">if</span>(start &gt; end) <span style="color: #00cdcd;">return</span> s;
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">rString</span>(s.begin() + start, s.begin() + end + 1);
  <span style="color: #00cdcd;">return</span> rString;
}
</pre>




<p>
Now the above function works - but just looking at it, you can feel
that the solution is not elegant. Right off the bat, you notice that
trim is really a combination of ltrim and rtrim, so you are better off
creating two separate function (ltrim,rtrim) and composing those to
form trim. 
</p>
<p>
Then secondly - you notice that we are dealing with a lot of low level
array logic. Is that really necessary - you are already in C++ land -
why treat it as char*'s ? Looking at the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/">string reference</a>, some
functions should jump out at you - find_first_not_of and
find_last_not_of. We can use those functions in combination with erase
to get rid of all our if/for logic.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the second pass of the solution now
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">ltrim</span>(string&amp; s) {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">pos</span> = s.find_first_not_of(<span style="color: #ffaf87;">" "</span>);
  s.erase(0,pos);
}

<span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">rtrim</span>(string&amp; s) {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">pos</span> = s.find_last_not_of(<span style="color: #ffaf87;">" "</span>);
  s.erase(pos+1);
}

<span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">trim</span>(string&amp; s) {
  ltrim(s);
  rtrim(s);
}
</pre>




<p>
Good yet? Maybe - but what if we want to trim say 'a's instead of
spaces? Out of luck aren't we? If we instead make the hard-coded space
a parameter we can trim any string we please! The final solution looks
like this - 
</p>



<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #00cdcd;">const</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">whitespaces</span>(<span style="color: #ffaf87;">" \f\n\r\t\v"</span>);

<span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">ltrim</span>(string&amp; s, <span style="color: #00cdcd;">const</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span>&amp; trim = whitespaces) {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">pos</span> = s.find_first_not_of(trim);
  s.erase(0,pos);
}

<span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">rtrim</span>(string&amp; s, <span style="color: #00cdcd;">const</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span>&amp; trim = whitespaces) {
  <span style="color: #87ff87;">size_t</span> <span style="color: #ffd787;">pos</span> = s.find_last_not_of(trim);
  s.erase(pos+1);

}

<span style="color: #87ff87;">void</span> <span style="color: #87d7ff;">trim</span>(string&amp; s, <span style="color: #00cdcd;">const</span> <span style="color: #87ff87;">string</span>&amp; trim = whitespaces) {
  ltrim(s, trim);
  rtrim(s, trim);
}  
</pre>




<p>
Isn't the new solution so much more elegant, simpler to understand,
and extensible at the same time! Therefore, I advocate getting it done
first, and then re-writing your code ( really - re-writing takes very
little time while it is still fresh in your head!). Combining this
technique, you prevent yourself from over-engineering and obsessing
about perfect code when you don't really know what you are doing, and
after you have a 'dirty' version, you can literally 'see' a lot of
things that need to be fixed! 
</p>
<p>
So this very simple and basic function - trim, taught me some good
lessons about coding. Needless to say - I never managed to get through
with figuring out the Hungarian Algorithm, but I feel I learned
something much better: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Break code into small, modular functions.Yes this can be done while
   refactoring, instead of in the beginning.
</li>
<li>Use existing code/function calls/libraries -recognize when you are
   doing too much work! After all for software developes laziness
   seems to be touted as a virtue.
</li>
<li>Make things extensible, but don't needlessly over-engineer to begin
   with. KISS. 
</li>
<li>Rewrite code as soon as you write it, when everything is fresh in
   your head - and everyone will think you are awesome :)
</li>
<li>Even simple problems can teach a lot! 
</li>
</ol>
