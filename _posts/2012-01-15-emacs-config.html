<p>
As every emacs tinkerer knows, over time, your .emacs configuration
file grows and grows, till it becomes impossible to manage.

The best tip I picked up over the web was to use <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>, along with
<a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">org-babel</a> to organize my .emacs file! Org-babel essentially allows you
to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> in org-mode! For any emacs newbie/tinkerer,
if you copy-paste a lot of customizations from different places on the
web I would highly recommend doing this, since this will make it very easy
to customize your emacs over time and across different machines!
</p>
<p>
The snippet below is what I have in my .emacs
</p>


<pre class="example">;; add the locations of emacs-org/ other extenstions
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org-7.01h/lisp")
(require 'cl)

;; set-up org babel
(setq org-babel-load-languages '((emacs-lisp . t)))
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
(require 'org-install)
(require 'org)

;; load neatly organized org file!
(org-babel-load-file "~/org/emacs-config.org")
</pre>




<p>
And then each new customization goes in my emacs-config.org
in the following format&hellip;
</p>

This allows me to use collect different enhancements/configs from
across various places, and keep my .emacs organized into neat
sections using org-mode! Even if you don't have too much in your .emacs right now, over
time you will always find new things to add to it, so I highly
recommend getting started with this setup before it's too late.
