as software developers we xxneed to learn, and learn fast in order to
stay competivite Thats why we ned to optimize for learning  how do we
otimize learning. each person learns niquely. recognize your
style. see what works for you. experiment . do it consciusy. yes that
should help. how do i do it? 
</p>
<p>
Recognize ineficienceies. learn. google. don't ask for help till you
must. googleing show you lots of different things. read, read
fast. you ned to be able to make it . speed reading
anyone. skim. collect. recall. Collect collect. If you can quickly
recall what you had found, you are halfway there. Information
management system - orgm ode anyone? This is why free writing is kind
of awesome, i have more words than i would ever think possible. talk
to people, read blogs, help other people. those are solutions to
problems you didn't have to waste time comming accross. Win win! Isn't
that awesome. Learn to optimize for time, but feel free to wander. use
instapaper. track the hell out of everything, and i mean
everything. yes that is key - you can't improve what you can't
track. consciously self improve. don't leave it to random dumb
luck. master your editor. power through task to get more time to learn
new things. consiously learn new things - you might need it some
day. experiment as much as possible. read. learn. have fun. take
breaks, but also force yourself. write code, lots of it. write
throwaway code, like freewriting, but free coding. its kind of
liberating if you think of it. learn, read, but the important thing is
consciou learning, consious easy recall. make a system. org mode ,
store everyting. grep later. if you store you remember how you did it,
and don't have to work through the logic again. in the long run it
actually saves you a bunch of time. why is it that it is always easy
to recall from a text book you've read before vs a new
texbook. familiarlity. brain remmebers a lot of shit. enhance
recall. learn to learn, biggest bang for the buck. don't do things
mindlessly. it really helps to be able to learn for learning
sakes. but sometimes it helps to have a learning plan as well. learn
by doing don't pressure yourself. just do something, instead of
thinking about doing somthing. that is the most improtant thing i
would say don't you thinkg. if you just did something, wrote a blog
post instead of thinking about writing a blog post! this idea has been
brewing in my head for so long, but i have always been reluctant to
actually get down and write, but freewiring is liberating ,
good. quantitiy over quality. quality comes with quantitiy. making
mistakes. producing shit. yes that kind of works! believe it or not,
just produce somehting, anything. really that should help the hell out
of you. it really wikll. get creating . once you start creating , its
an addiction you can't stop. and you'll love the feeling. the more you
create the better you get, the more alive you feel. and then something
wonderful happens, over time you actully start producing good work,
yes work people admire, suddenly you are no logner shitty. when did
this happen huh. Practice, copy. don't always look for the why am i
doing this . that demotivates. side projects seem stupid in the larger
perspective, but really if you think of it as an exercise, something
you are forced to do, then it is no longer for charity, but just
something that has to get done attititure. once you 'just get
something done' you realize you are doing more, producing more, and
really it helps. isn't that wonderful. you have learnt to learn. this
is amazing. and if you learning you are growing. might not be obvious,
and you sunk a lot of time into something that is completely useless,
but hey better than freaking thinkging about doing and never doing
anything becuase it won't be useful right. so what if it usn't
usefull, watching reruns of friends isn't really useful either is it now?.
