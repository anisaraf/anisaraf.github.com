   Reading this problem for the first time it is natural to feel
   overwhelmed. Take a deep breath, relax and think about <a href="http://www.mathopenref.com/coordintro.html">coordinate geometry</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path">Eulerian paths</a>. Let's look at a sample
   input. 
</p>
<p>
   Input = {"0 0 1 0", "2 0 4 0", "5 0 8 0", "9 0 13 0", "0 1 1 1", "2
   1 4 1", "5 1 8 1", "9 1 13 1", "0 0 0 1", "1 0 1 1", "2 0 2 1", "3
   0 3 1", "4 0 4 1", "5 0 5 1", "6 0 6 1", "7 0 7 1", "8 0 8 1", "9 0
   9 1", "10 0 10 1", "11 0 11 1", "12 0 12 1", "13 0 13 1"}
</p>

   Looking at the input and the picture, the first part of our
   algorithm becomes a little clearer - we need to use <b>coordinate    geometry to convert the input points</b> to accurately represent the
   picture. Once we have line segments representing the picture, it
   isn't too difficult to take the leap and see that we can <b>easily    translate that picture into a graph</b> where the points are vertexes
   and the line joining the points can be depicted as edges in the
   graph.
</p>
<p>
   Let's <b>rephrase the problem now - given a graph, how many paths are</b>
   <b>required to trace all the edges exactly once starting at any    vertex?</b> Luckily for us this is a standard graph theory problem with
   a known solution. The key takeaway here is getting to the point
   where you can rephrase the question. Even if you are haven't heard
   of Euler paths, a quick google search on the rephrased question
   should bring you enough articles to get you to the final solution!
   So your excuse that you are unfamiliar with advanced graph theory
   shouldn't be a total stumbling block.

<p>   Since the lines are horizontal and vertical, it is a lot simpler to
   use simple logic to find the points of intersection than go with
   the complex co-ordinate geometry equations. Of course, if you are
   interested, <a href="http://www.mathisfunforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=3301">these equations</a> can be pretty handy to know ! 
</p>
<p>
   After we have all the line segments, we get into the graph theory
   to see exactly how this leads us to our solution. For each
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)">connected component</a> in the graph, if ‘n’ (as specified in the
   problem) is even then each vertex in the graph will have an even
   number of edges and hence we can trace an Eulerian circuit. Thus we
   don’t need to lift our pen ! If however there are odd edges, there
   must be an even number of odd degrees. If we divide that number by
   2 we get the number of paths in the graph required to trace all the
   edges. This is equivalent to saying the number of PenLift’s
   required to trace each edge in the graph ! <b>Phew, stop</b>. Let that
   sink in.

<p>   Since the code in this blog is meant more for learning than just
   solving the problem - I am going to be breaking the code into
   various classes, and making it a lot more verbose than it needs to
   be for this particular problem. I am going to be writing different
   classes - namely <a href="http://gist.github.com/608159">PenLift</a>( containing the main algorithm) , Graph
   (to represent our graph), Line ( to represent the line segments)
   and Point ( to represent the endpoints of the line segment). The
   hope is that the Graph, Line, Point classes will be usable for
   future problems as well ! Lets get our hand's dirty now shall we

<p>
Most of the heavy lifting in this function is done by calling other
function's but reading it does outline all the blabbering I did above!
The first thing we go is convert all the strings in the input to
Line objects. Once we have these Line objects, we <b>merge all those line segments</b> which are adjacent to each other, thus removing redundant
line segments. Think about it for a second - do we really need to
remove the redundant lines? If we didn't wouldn't that just create
extra vertices in our graph? Should that really affect our answer ?
The answer is Yes it would - can you come up with a scenario before
proceeding further?
</p>

<p> 
After we <b>merge the lines</b>, we must <b>intersect the lines</b> to create
vertices at the point of intersections, or in effect break our long
line segments into smaller pieces. After this step we should have all
the line segments as drawn out in the input picture above. Now we call
the function <b>createGraph()</b>, which basically converts all these line
segments into a graph. We break this graph into a list of graphs of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)">connected components</a> - do you see why we need that? Then for each of
the components we calculate the PenLifts required, and return the sum
of them - 1 . Do you see why we need to subtract one at the end? Do
you see why we return the number of connected components when we have
n as even? <b>Think about this. Let it marinate</b>. I'll be back next week
with more Code and explanations for each of the above functions. In
the meantime why don't you get your <b>hands dirty?</b>
