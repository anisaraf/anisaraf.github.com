Recently I stumbled upon this [[http://www.flcdatacenter.com/CaseH1B.aspx][corpus]] of H-1B data. Now it seemed like
a good data set to explore so I decided to download the H-1B iCert LCA
Data files for the years 2002-2010.

After downloading the first step was to try and load it into a mySQL
database. While the downloading was effortless using [[http://linux.die.net/man/1/wget][wget]], loading the data into
a mySQL database turned out to be a much bigger hassle than I
anticipated - specially since some of the files had different headers
than the other. Anyway to cut a long story short, I ended up writing
this script to take a CSV file and create a table from the header! Now
the table doesn't do the data types but it does give out the SQL /
create the table so that you can edit the table data types either in
text or using [[http://www.webyog.com/en/][SQLyog]] [[http://code.google.com/p/sqlyog/downloads/list][Community Edition]]. 

#+begin_src perl

 func getTableSQL($header, $tableName, :$defaultLen=100, :$engine="InnoDB", :$dbh=undef) {
    my ($rSql, $cols);
    my $csv = Text::CSV->new();
    if ($csv->parse($header)) {
	foreach ($csv->fields()){
	    $cols .= "`$_` varchar($defaultLen) DEFAULT NULL, \n";
	}
	$rSql = "CREATE TABLE `$tablename` ( $cols ) ENGINE=$engine DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;";
	substr $rSql, rindex($rSql,','), 1, ''; #replace last comma
    } else {
	say "Failed to parse line:".$csv->error_input;
    }

    if($dbh) {
	return $dbh->do($rSql);
    }
    else {
	return $rSql;
    }
}
#+end_src 

The code is fed the header as a string, and it produces a CREATE TABLE
command from the header. Optionally, if you provide it a database
handle it will go ahead and create the table for you as well. I know a
lot of people seem to think [[http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1906070][perl is ugly]] yada yada yada, but its quick
and [[http://www.cpan.org/index.html][CPAN]] has a module for everything. So while it might not be as
glamorous as Ruby, Python etc. it is kind of awesome in its own way

Anyway now that I had the tables ready to go I decided to load the
data in using the the MySQL [[http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html][LOAD DATA INFILE]] command only to hit
[[http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39247][this unresolved bug]]. Really MySQL - you can't load a freaking data
file into the database! Anyways, after doing some more nifty perl
coding (to come in a later post) I was finally able to get all the
data loaded into the database. 

A quick snapshot of the approximate number of LCA efilings for each year!

#+begin_src gnuplot :var data=filings :file ../images/h1filings.png :exports none

 set terminal png notransparent medium size 500,400 \
                      xffffff x000000 x404040 \

                      xadd8e6 x0000ff xdda0dd x9500d3    # defaults

  set yrange [100000:500000]
  set ylabel "Number of Filings"

  set xlabel "Year"
  set xtics rotate by -45
  set tic scale 0 

  set title 'H-1B 2 Yearly Filings'
  
  plot data using 2:xticlabels(1) w lp lw 2 notitle

As you can see from the graph and the data table, there was an
expected dip in the H-1B filings during the recession(2009). I'll be
doing some more analysis on the data soon so if there is anything in
particular you will like to know about this data, leave some comments
and I'll see what I can do!
