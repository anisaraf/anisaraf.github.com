Learning to Learn:

As software developers, we need to be rapidly taking in information
and learning all the time. Therefore, it is essential that to become
better we become better learners. Now, each person has his own unique
learning style, and I feel it is important that they *consciously*
discover what works for them. This post is not advice, but mostly self
reflection, in an effort for me to optimize my own learning!



* Some things I have noticed makes me an efficient learner

** Be consciously learning all the time. 
*** What do I mean by consciously learning? It means you need to make a conscious effort to learn, because otherwise you will stagnaate 



** Don't ask for help

** Learn how to recognize useful information. Read fast

** Be helpful

** Collect / blog / talk

** Track - Time Management

** Learn by doing, skim by reading

** Quality over quantity

** Do useless things
