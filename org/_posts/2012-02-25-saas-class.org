I am following coursera's [[https://www.coursera.org/saas/class/index][saas-class]]  online, and using this post for
keeping track of progress/notes/links etc. These notes are very rough,
mostly a personal log of progress...

* Lecture notes
** Engineering Software is Different from Engineering Hardware (02/25)
*** Legacy code: old SW meet customer's needs, but difficult to evolve due to design elegance
*** Waterfall vs Agile
    - Requirements analysis and specification
    - Architectural design
    - Implementation
    - Verfication
    - Operations and Maintenance
    - Works well for important software with specs
    - Plan to throw one away - you are going to anyway ;)
    - If a problem has no solution, it may not be a problem, but a
      fact, not to be solved, but to be coped with over time.(Peres's Law)
    - Individuals and interactions over processes & tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan
    - Embrace change as a fact of life
*** Assurance
    - Verification - Did you build the thing *right*
    - Validation - Did you build the *right* thing
    - Testing - Exhaustive testing infeasible
    - Use Automation, Coverage, Regression testing, Integration
      testing, Test Driven Design
*** Productivity
    - Clarity via conciseness
      + Syntax: short and easier to read
      + Raise the level of abstraction
    - Synthesis
      + Automatic code generation
    - Reuse
      + Procedures and functions
      + Standardized Libraries
      + OOP
      + Design Patterns
    - Automation and tools
      + Replace tedious manual tasks with automation to save time,
        improve accuracy
      + Concerns (Dependability/ UI)
      + IMPORTANT SKILL - LEARN NEW TOOLS ALL THE TIME
*** Sotware as a service
    - SaaS delivers SW & data as a service
    - No install worries
    - No data loss
    - Easy for groups to interact with same data
    - No compatibility hassles for developers
    - 1 copy - easier upgrades/features
*** SOA
    - SW architecture where all components are designed to be services
    - Apps composed of interoperable services
    - [[ http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3101876][Steve Yeggi's SOA rant]]
*** Cloud computing, fallacies, pitfalls
    - Communication 
    - Scalability
    - Dependability
    - Cluster - commodity hardware
    - Utility Computing / Public Cloud Computing
    - AWS - 42nd fastest computer in the world @ $700/hr!
** SaaS Architecture
