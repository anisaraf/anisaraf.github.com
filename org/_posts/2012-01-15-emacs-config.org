As every emacs tinkerer knows, over time, your .emacs configuration
file grows and grows, till it becomes impossible to manage.

The best tip I picked up over the web was to use [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], along with
[[%20http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]] to organize my .emacs file! Org-babel essentially allows you
to do [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] in org-mode! For any emacs newbie/tinkerer,
if you copy-paste a lot of customizations from different places on the
web I would highly recommend doing this, since this will make it very easy
to customize your emacs over time and across different machines!

The snippet below is what I have in my .emacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; add the locations of emacs-org/ other extenstions
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org-7.01h/lisp")
  (require 'cl)
  
  ;; set-up org babel
  (setq org-babel-load-languages '((emacs-lisp . t)))
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
  (require 'org-install)
  (require 'org)
  
  ;; load neatly organized org file!
  (org-babel-load-file "~/org/emacs-config.org")
#+end_src 

And then each new customization goes in my emacs-config.org
in the following format...

#+BEGIN_HTML: 
   <center>
#+END_HTML: 
   [[file:../images/emacs-config.png]]
#+BEGIN_HTML: 
   </center>
#+END_HTML: 

This allows me to use collect different enhancements/configs from
across various places, and keep my .emacs organized into neat
sections using org-mode! Even if you don't have too much in your .emacs right now, over
time you will always find new things to add to it, so I highly
recommend getting started with this setup before it's too late.
